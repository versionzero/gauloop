Herein lies a set of modern C++ generic wrappers for the Genetic
Algorithm Utility Library (GAUL).  

Please note that this is a weekend project, and as such will likely be
a work in progress for some time.  That being said, since I do want to
use it sooner than later, progress on it should be swift, albeit
intermittent at times.  Furthermore: I have a few applications in
mind, so it's is also likely that the addition of new mappings to the
C API will follow the requirements of the projects I am working on.

That's it. One day this might actually be useful.
